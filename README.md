# rkresheroku

The purpose is this app is to deploy my CV to an accessible host.
This is also an intentionally simplified code in order to easily deploy to Heroku.  
The bundle.js file is coming from another repository 'rkresheroku' which creates
the bundled file and copied here.  Doing this simplifies deployment, in my opinion.
